### What is Citizenly?

Citizenly is an app that helps immigrants navigate the naturalization process using AI tools.

As of now, you can do two things in Citizenly:

1. Practice for your citizenship interview.

Citizenly will simulate an immigration officer asking you questions for your naturalization test. It'll grade your responses and tell you if you passed. You'll get instant feedback.

2. Ask questions to an automated legal consultant

Citizenly will answer your questions about legal documents. Scan a document that's been giving you trouble, and ask any questions to Citizenly that you have about it. It'll answer your questions in your native language
